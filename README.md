# AndroidDesignSupportLibDemo
This is my first repository on github. I tried to find out demo and example of Android Design Support Library which is recently released by the google. It has so many nice features. Great UI improvement by Google. Its a worth to read and explore.  Thanks for such nice features and it reduce the developers effort in customization and in designing.

In this demo application is used https://github.com/Quinny898/PersistentSearch library for the search view.




This is the just demo application that I prepared to learn the Support Library. And I thought that It might be helpful to others that want to learn it.

You can use this code in your project without any permission. Its publically available and you are free to do anything with it.

You found any bug and resolved it, just comit it. Still I am working on it and planning to implement navigation drawer.
